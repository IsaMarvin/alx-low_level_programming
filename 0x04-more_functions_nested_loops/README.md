# 0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops :sparkles:

This directory contains solutions to various tasks related to more functions and nested loops in the C programming language. Each task is represented by a separate C file with a specific function to complete. The tasks cover topics such as character manipulation, multiplication, printing numbers, drawing shapes, and more.

## Programs üìú

1. **0-isupper.c**: Uppercase Character üëÜ

   - Usage: The function can be called to check if a character is a digit.

3. **2-mul.c**: Multiply Function ‚úñÔ∏è
   - Description: Write a function to multiply two integers.
   - Prototype: `int mul(int a, int b)`
   - Usage: The function can be called to multiply two integers.

4. **3-print_numbers.c**: Print Numbers 0 to 9 üî¢
   - Description: Write a function to print the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. You can only use the `_putchar` function twice in your code.
   - Prototype: `void print_numbers(void)`
   - Usage: The function can be called to print the numbers.

5. **4-print_most_numbers.c**: Print Most Numbers 0 to 9 (Except 2 and 4) üö´
   - Description: Write a function to print the numbers from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4, followed by a new line. You can only use the `_putchar` function twice in your code.
   - Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void)`
   - Usage: The function can be called to print the numbers.

6. **5-more_numbers.c**: Print More Numbers 0 to 14 (Ten Times) üî¢
   - Description: Write a function to print the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times, followed by a new line. You can only use the `_putchar` function three times in your code.
   - Prototype: `void more_numbers(void)`
   - Usage: The function can be called to print the numbers.

7. **6-print_line.c**: Draw a Straight Line üìè
   - Description: Write a function to draw a straight line in the terminal using the character `_`. The line should end with a new line (`\n`). If `n` is 0 or less, the function should only print a new line.
   - Prototype: `void print_line(int n)`
   - Usage: The function can be called to draw a line.

8. **7-print_diagonal.c**: Draw a Diagonal Line ‚ûñ
   - Description: Write a function to draw a diagonal line in the terminal using the character `\`. The diagonal should end with a new line (`\n`). If `n` is 0 or less, the function should only print a new line.
   - Prototype: `void print_diagonal(int n)`
   - Usage: The function can be called to draw a diagonal line.

9. **8-print_square.c**: Print a Square ‚ñ¢
   - Description: Write a function to print a square in the terminal using the character `#`. The square should be of size `size`. If `size` is 0 or less, the function should only print a new line.
   - Prototype: `void print_square(int size)`
   - Usage: The function can be called to print a square.

10. **9-fizz_buzz.c**: Fizz-Buzz Test üçª
    - Description: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
    - Usage: The program can be executed to print the Fizz-Buzz test.

11. **10-print_triangle.c**: Print a Triangle ‚ñ≤
    - Description: Write a function to print a triangle in the terminal using the character `#`. The triangle should have a size of `size`. If `size` is 0 or less, the function should only print a new line.
    - Prototype: `void print_triangle(int size)`
    - Usage: The function can be called to print a triangle.

12. **100-prime_factor.c**: Largest Prime Factor üåü
    - Description: Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
    - Usage: The program can be executed to find and print the largest prime factor.

13. **101-print_number.c**: Print an Integer üî¢
    - Description: Write a function to print an integer using the `_putchar` function. You are not allowed to use `long`, arrays, or pointers. You are also not allowed to hard-code special values.
    - Prototype: `void print_number(int n)`
    - Usage: The function can be called to print an integer.
