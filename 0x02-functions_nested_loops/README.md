### 9: Times Table Printing :1234: :heavy_multiplication_x:

- File: `9-times_table.c`
- Description: This program defines a function `times_table` that prints the 9 times table, starting from 0, in a specific format.
- Prototype: `void times_table(void)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print the times table.

### 10: Addition of Two Integers :heavy_plus_sign:

- File: `10-add.c`
- Description: This program defines a function `add` that adds two integers and returns the result.
- Prototype: `int add(int a, int b)`
- Usage: The function can be called to perform addition on two integers.

### 11: Printing Natural Numbers :1234:

- File: `11-print_to_98.c`
- Description: This program defines a function `print_to_98` that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98, separated by a comma and space.
- Prototype: `void print_to_98(int n)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print the natural numbers in ascending order.

### 12: Printing n Times Table :1234: :heavy_multiplication_x:

- File: `12-times_table.c`
- Description: This program defines a function `print_times_table` that prints the n times table, starting from 0, in a specific format. It prints the table only if the given number is between 0 and 15 (inclusive).
- Prototype: `void print_times_table(int n)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print the times table for a given number.

### 13: Sum of Multiples :heavy_plus_sign: :1234: :heavy_multiplication_x:
