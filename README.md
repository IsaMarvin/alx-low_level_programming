# C Programming Repository 🌟

Welcome to the C Programming Repository! 🚀 This repository contains multiple directories, each focusing on different aspects of C programming and coding exercises. Each directory represents a project and includes a README file with specific tasks and instructions.

## Projects 📁

Here are the projects available in this repository:

### [0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world)
Here are some C programming tasks to sharpen your skills and explore different aspects of the C language. 💯

Tasks in the project include:
- Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.✨
- Write a script that compiles a C file without linking. 🔗
- and more...

Please refer to the [README](./0x00-hello_world/README.md) file inside the directory for detailed instructions and code examples to complete each task.

### [0x01-variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
The Conditions and Loops project focuses on advanced conditional statements and loop structures in C programming. Through various tasks, you will learn how to use if-else statements, while loops, for loops, and nested loops effectively.

Tasks in the project include:
- Checking various conditions using if-else statements and printing the corresponding message ✅
- Printing the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase using loops and the putchar function 🆎
- Printing the alphabet while excluding specific letters using conditional statements and loops ❌
- and more...

To complete each task, navigate to the [0x01-variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) directory and follow the instructions provided in the [README](./0x01-variables_if_else_while/README.md) file.
