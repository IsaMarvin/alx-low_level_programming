# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings 👆🔢🔤

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of pointers, arrays, and strings in various functions. Each program focuses on a specific task and provides a solution using C programming concepts.

## Programs 📜

### 0: Reset to 98 ♻️

- File: `0-reset_to_98.c`
- Description: This function takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to, setting it to 98.
- Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n)`
- Usage: The function can be called to update an integer to 98.

### 1: Swap Integers 🔃

- File: `1-swap.c`
- Description: This function swaps the values of two integers using pointers.
- Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b)`
- Usage: The function can be called to swap the values of two integers.

### 2: String Length 📏

- File: `2-strlen.c`
- Description: This function returns the length of a string (the number of characters in it) excluding the null terminator '\0'.
- Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s)`
- Usage: The function can be called to find the length of a string.

### 3: Print String 📃

- File: `3-puts.c`
- Description: This function prints a string followed by a new line to the standard output (stdout).
- Prototype: `void _puts(char *str)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print a string.

### 4: Print String in Reverse 🔁

- File: `4-print_rev.c`
- Description: This function prints a string in reverse order followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print a string in reverse.

### 5: Reverse String 🔁🔃

- File: `5-rev_string.c`
- Description: This function reverses a string in place.
- Prototype: `void rev_string(char *s)`
- Usage: The function can be called to reverse a string.

### 6: Print Every Other Character ⏩

- File: `6-puts2.c`
- Description: This function prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void puts2(char *str)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print every other character of a string.

### 7: Print Second Half of String ➡️

- File: `7-puts_half.c`
- Description: This function prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, it prints the last `n` characters of the string, where `n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2`.
- Prototype: `void puts_half(char *str)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print the second half of a string.

### 8: Print Array of Integers 🔢

- File: `8-print_array.c`
- Description: This function prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. The numbers are separated by commas and spaces.
- Prototype: `void print_array(int *a, int n)`
- Usage: The function can be called to print elements of an integer array.

### 9: Copy String 📋

- File: `9-strcpy.c`
- Description: This function copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
- Prototype: `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src)`
- Return Value: The pointer to `dest`.
- Usage: The function can be called to copy a string.

### 10: Convert String to Integer 🔢🔢

- File: `100-atoi.c`
- Description: This function converts a string to an integer.
- Prototype: `int _atoi(char *s)`
- Return Value: The converted integer.
- Usage: The function can be called to convert a string to an integer.

Happy coding! 🚀
