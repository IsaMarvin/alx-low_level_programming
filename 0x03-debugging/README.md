# 0x03 C - Debugging üêû

This directory contains C programs that focus on debugging and fixing issues in existing code. Each program represents a specific debugging task and requires modification or fixing to achieve the desired functionality. Below is a description of each task along with the corresponding files involved.

## Task 0: Testing positive_or_negative()

- File: `0-main.c`
- File: `main.h`

In this task, the objective is to test the `positive_or_negative()` function in a case where the input is 0. The existing code is provided for testing purposes, and no modifications are required. Your task is to create a file named `0-main.c` and copy the given code into it. The output should display "0 is zero."

## Task 1: Fixing Infinite Loop

- File: `1-main.c`

The code provided in `1-main.c` causes an infinite loop. Your task is to comment out the part of the code that causes the infinite loop while maintaining the line count. You should not add or remove any lines of code. After making the necessary modifications, the output should display "Infinite loop incoming :(" followed by "Infinite loop avoided! \\o/".

## Task 2: Finding the Largest Number

- File: `2-largest_number.c`
- File: `main.h`

The existing code in `2-largest_number.c` is supposed to find the largest of three integers. However, it currently produces incorrect results. Your task is to fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly identifies and returns the largest number among the three integers.

## Task 3: Handling Leap Years

- File: `3-print_remaining_days.c`
- File: `main.h`

The code in `3-print_remaining_days.c` converts a date to the day of the year and determines the number of days left in the year, taking leap years into consideration. However, there are issues with handling leap years, resulting in incorrect output in some cases. Your task is to fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that it correctly handles all dates and leap years.


Happy debugging! :bug: :wrench:
