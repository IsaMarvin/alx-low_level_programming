# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while 📚💡🔍🔄

This collection of C programs covers various topics, including variables, if-else statements, and loops. Each program serves as a small exercise to help you improve your C programming skills. Let's take a look at the completed tasks and their titles:

## Task 0: [0-positive_or_negative.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

📝 Check if a Number is Positive or Negative

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero. 🚀🔢🤔

## Task 1: [1-last_digit.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)

📝 Print the Last Digit of a Number

This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`. 🚀🔢👌

## Task 2: [2-print_alphabet.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)

📝 Print the Alphabet in Lowercase

This program prints the lowercase alphabet in a single line, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function. 🚀🔠📄

## Task 3: [3-print_alphabets.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)

📝 Print Lowercase and Uppercase Alphabets

This program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by the uppercase alphabet, all in a single line and separated by a new line, using only the `putchar` function. 🚀🔠🆙

## Task 4: [4-print_alphabt.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)

📝 Print Alphabet Without 'q' and 'e'

This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function. 🚀🔠❌

## Task 5: [5-print_numbers.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)

📝 Print Single-Digit Numbers

This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 (from 0 to 9) in a single line, followed by a new line. 🚀🔢0️⃣9️⃣

## Task 6: [6-print_numberz.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)

📝 Print Single-Digit Numbers (No Char Variables)

This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 (from 0 to 9) in a single line, followed by a new line, without using character variables. 🚀🔢0️⃣9️⃣

## Task 7: [7-print_tebahpla.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)

📝 Print Alphabet in Reverse

This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function. 🚀🔠🔄

## Task 8: [8-print_base16.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)

📝 Print Hexadecimal Numbers (Lowercase)

This program prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function. 🚀🔢🔡

## Task 9: [9-print_comb.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)

📝 Print Combinations of Single-Digit Numbers

This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and a space, in ascending order. 🚀🔢

## Task 10: [100-print_comb3.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)

📝 Print Combinations of Two Different Single-Digit Numbers

This program prints all possible combinations of two different single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and a space, in ascending order. 🚀🔢 

## Task 11: [101-print_comb4.c](../0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)

📝 Print Combinations of Three Different Single-Digit Numbers

This program prints all possible combinations of three different single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and a space, in ascending order. 🚀🔢
