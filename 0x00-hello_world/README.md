### 0x00. C - Hello, World

Here are some C programming tasks to sharpen your skills and explore different aspects of the C language. Each task has a specific objective and instructions for completion. Happy coding! üñ•Ô∏è

#### Task List

0Ô∏è‚É£ **Preprocess C File:**
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

   Instructions:
   - Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable `$CFILE`.
   - Save the preprocessed output in a file named `c`.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Compile C File (No Linking):**
Write a script that compiles a C file without linking.

   Instructions:
   - Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable `$CFILE`.
   - Generate the output file by replacing the `.c` extension with `.o`.
   - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.o`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate Assembly Code:**
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.

   Instructions:
   - Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable `$CFILE`.
   - Generate the output file by replacing the `.c` extension with `.s`.
   - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Compile and Create Executable:**
Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".

   Instructions:
   - Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable `$CFILE`.
   - Create the executable named "cisfun".

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Print String:**
Write a C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

   Instructions:
   - Use the `puts` function to print the string.
   - Ensure the program ends with the value `0`.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Print with Proper Grammar:**
Write a C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line.

   Instructions:
   - Use the `printf` function to print the string.
   - Ensure the program returns `0`.
   - Compile the program without warnings using the `-Wall` gcc option.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Print Size of Types:**
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

   Instructions:
   - Your program should produce the same output as the example provided.
   - Warnings are allowed.
   - Ensure the program returns `0`.
   - Note: You might need to install the package `libc6-dev-i386` on Linux to test the `-m32` gcc option.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate Assembly Code (Intel Syntax):**
Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file and saves it in an output file.

   Instructions:
   - Set the C file name to the value stored in the variable `$CFILE`.
   - Generate the output file by replacing the `.c` extension with `.s`.
   - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Print Art to Standard Error:**
Write a C program that prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.

   Instructions:
   - Do not use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts.
   - Ensure the program returns `1`.
   - Compile the program without any warnings using the `-Wall` gcc option.
