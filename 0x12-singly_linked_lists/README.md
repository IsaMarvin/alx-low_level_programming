# Project: C - Singly Linked Lists

This directory contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of singly linked lists.

## Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Task 0: Print a List
- ðŸ“„ File: 0-print_list.c
- Implement a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list. If the `str` is `NULL`, it should print `[0] (nil)`.

### Task 1: Count the Elements
- ðŸ“„ File: 1-list_len.c
- Create a function that returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list.

### Task 2: Add a Node at the End
- ðŸ“„ File: 3-add_node_end.c
- Write a function to add a new node at the end of a `list_t` list. The `str` value should be duplicated, and it should return the address of the new element.

### Task 3: Free a List
- ðŸ“„ File: 4-free_list.c
- Implement a function to free a `list_t` list, ensuring there are no memory leaks.

### Assembly Programming Challenge ðŸ’»
- ðŸ“„ File: 101-hello_holberton.asm
- Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints "Hello, Holberton" followed by a new line using only the `printf` function and no interrupts.
